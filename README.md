# Dicee_Game
The project that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a fun and simple game that allows two players to roll dice and compete against each other to see who can get the highest number. The game is based on chance, with each player's dice rolling randomly to generate a number between 1 and 6. The player with the higher number wins the round.
